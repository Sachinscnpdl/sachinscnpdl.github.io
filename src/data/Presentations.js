    title: 'Thermal-Structural Modeling of Additively Manufactured Ni-YSZ Layers for SOFC Electrodes',
    conference: 'Additive Manufacturing Meeting, Wroclaw, Poland',
    date: '2025-06-04',
    type: 'Oral Presentation',
    description: 'This presentation delves into the thermal-structural modeling of Ni-YSZ layers used in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) electrodes, with a particular emphasis on additive manufacturing techniques. The challenge of welding metals and ceramics, which have distinct material properties like thermal conductivity and absorption coefficients, necessitates tailored process parameters. The study highlights the need for innovative design solutions to optimize laser supervision based on surface material types.',
